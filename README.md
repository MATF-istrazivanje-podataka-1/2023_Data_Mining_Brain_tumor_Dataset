This is a brain tumor feature dataset including five first-order features and eight texture features with the target level (in the column Class).

* First Order Features
  * Mean
  * Variance
  * Standard Deviation
  * Skewness
  * Kurtosis
  
* Second Order Features
  * Contrast
  * Energy
  * ASM (Angular second moment)
  * Entropy
  * Homogeneity
  * Dissimilarity
  * Correlation
  * Coarseness
  
Image column defines image name and Class column defines either the image has tumor or not (1 = Tumor, 0 = Non-Tumor)
